Gridded Datasets created using ocean observations (or ocean reanalysis) are analysed in the repository. The scripts are test purposes only.

The followig datasets are considered,
1. Met Office EN4 dataset (gridded T/S global, 1900-Present)
      EN4 dataset can be downloaded using the link below
      https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/en4/download-en4-2-2.html

2. NCAR CORE.2 Dataset (Air-sea flux, 1949-2006)
      Air-sea flux dataset can be downloaded using the link below
      https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/corev2-air-sea-surface-fluxes

Both the above datasets provide monthly diagnostics on 1 deg x 1 deg grid.

Additionally, following datasets could be used
1. OAFLUX: Objectively analyzed air-sea fluxes for the global oceans
